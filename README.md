# TravellerSystemGenerator
System generator for Traveller, based on the Mongoose World Builder's Handbook.

This is at a very early stage.
The primary star is generated, including it's type, subtype, class, mass and temperture
Note:
- brown drawfs and white dwarfs are generated, but not their mass and temperture
- mass variance is included, but not temperture variance.
